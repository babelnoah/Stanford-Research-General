# Stanford-Research-General
General code created for research at Marcus Feldman's Theoretical Biology Lab. Includes initial brainstorming and different models not included in the final publication.

## Final Publication Code

The code and models that were ultimately included in  my final publication can be found in a separate repository. This includes the refined versions of my models and the exact simulations that were used to generate the results for my paper.
